Problem statement:
 The farmers in remote areas face a problem selling their products and often reach out to big companies to help them out. These companies eat the farmers' profit, giving barely minimal earnings to the farmers. Also, most farmers are unaware of the new schemes and policies released by the Indian government. Even though these policies are for them, they aren't able to benefit from them. All these policies can help the farmers tremendously by decreasing their loans or helping in terms of providing financial aid. Most farmers are unaware of the soil quality or the products they can use to increase the yield; hence this website will help them find the right resources to avail them. They will be fully aware of their rights and power and get the ability in their hands of whom to sell their products and at what price.
Oganic is a one-stop destination for the farmers of the nation. We aim to facilitate the process of sellers and buyers. A seller can easily price his products and exhibit them. A buyer - a retailer or regular people can buy from it without hassle. Sellers can quickly put their products in bulk cutting out the big companies who are the middlemen. 
A weather forecast feature will help the farmer decide what crop to grow and what to do with the existing grown crops factoring in the weather forecast.
A chat box on the side will aid our farmers in answering their questions regarding the crops, soil, or schemes. The website offers to call support 24x7 by the experts answering questions and the government helpline of the Kisan Call Center.
Our page focuses on educating the farmers, and the government schemes page will display the latest news and schemes released by the government.
The page provides the option to switch between English, Hindi, and regional languages.
